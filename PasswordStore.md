# Protocol Summary

PasswordStore is a protocol dedicated to storage and retrieval of a userÂ´s passwords. The protocol is designed to be used by a single user, and is not
designed to be used by multiple users. Only the owner should be able to set and access this password.

# Disclaimer

Gabriel Acero  makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Findings

## High

### [H-1] Storing the password on-chain makes it visable to anyone, and no longer private.


**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly 
from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intented to be a private variable and only 
accessed through the `PasswordStore::s_password` function, which is intented to be only called by the owner of the contract.

We show one such method of reading any data off chain below



**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** (Proof of Code)

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought.
One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain.
This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However,
you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send
a transaction with the password that decrypts your password.

### [H-2] ``PasswordStore::setPassword`` has no access controls, maening a non-owner could change the password.


**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be and `external` function, however,
the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>       // @audit - There are no access controls
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```


**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract, severly breaking the contract intented functionality.


**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test file.

<details>
<summary> Code </summary>

```javascript
     function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
        vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomAddress);
        string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
        assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control conditional to the `setPassword` function.

```javascript
    if (msg.sender != owner) {
        revert PasswordStore_NotOwner();
    }
```

## Informational

### [I-1] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a parameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect


**Description:**

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
     // @audit their is no newPassword parameter!
     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */  
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {}
```

The `PasswordStore::getPassword` function signature is `getPassword()` which the natspec says it should be `getPassword(string)`.

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line.

```diff
-    * @param newPassword The new password to set. 
```
